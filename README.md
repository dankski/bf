# Brainfuck Machine

For recreational purposes, I started developing a Brainfuck interpreter inspired by the following resources:

- [A Virtual Brainfuck Machine In Go - By Thorsten Ball](https://speakerdeck.com/mrnugget/a-virtual-brainfuck-machine)

- [Learn Rust by building a BF](https://freininghaus.github.io/blog/2024/02/04/brainfuck-interpreter-in-rust-part1/)
